      <description>Dialist started when someone couldn’t remember the name of a restaurant. The number was in their contacts app, but with hundreds of contacts and no name to search by it was essentially impossible to find. It would be great if they could have created a speed dial list exclusively for takeout!
This is where Dialist comes in. Dialist lets you build multiple speed dial lists, using your phone’s existing Contacts. As an added bonus, Dialist makes it easy to start a group text thread with some or all the members of a list.</description>
