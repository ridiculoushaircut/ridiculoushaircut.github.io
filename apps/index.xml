      <description>Dialist started when someone couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember the name of a restaurant. The number was in their contacts app, but with hundreds of contacts and no name to search by it was essentially impossible to find. Adding infrequently used contacts to the Favorites list would be an easy fix, but it just abuses and bloats the Favorites. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great if we could have multiple Favorites lists? One for work, one for family, one for takeout, etc.</description>
